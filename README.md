# ðŸ“° Fake News Prediction System

A machine learning-based system to classify news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Logistic Regression.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project leverages text classification methods to identify fake news using a combination of data preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and model training using Logistic Regression. It is built using Python and widely used machine learning and NLP libraries.

---

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

- **pandas** â€“ for data loading and manipulation  
- **nltk** â€“ for natural language processing tasks like stopword removal and stemming  
- **sklearn (scikit-learn)** â€“ for vectorization, model training, and evaluation  
- **string** â€“ for punctuation removal  
- **TfidfVectorizer** â€“ for converting text data into numerical feature vectors  
- **LogisticRegression** â€“ the classification algorithm used

## ðŸ”„ Process Flow

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Merge relevant fields such as `title` and `text` to form a complete news content.

### 2. Text Preprocessing
- Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Remove punctuation using Python's `string` module.
- Tokenize the text.
- Remove stopwords using NLTKâ€™s stopword list.
- Apply stemming using NLTK's `PorterStemmer` to reduce words to their root forms.

### 3. Vectorization
- Use `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` to transform the cleaned text into numerical vectors.

### 4. Model Training
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- Train a `LogisticRegression` model using the TF-IDF vectors.
- Fit the model with training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Predict using the trained model on the test set.
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy Score
